Valerie Slepak, vs111

Started: April 12, Finished: April 30

Hours Worked: 40+

Online Resources Used:
https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html
This was really helpful for learning and understanding how higher order components work, which proved helpful for my app when it came to protecting routes for authorized users only.

https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
React's Context API was also really helpful because when it came to an authorized user, I needed that data to be shared among different components. In my app, the authorized user is kept track of in the App component, which is the provider in the context, and passed along to the other components, which are the consumers.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users
https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write
The react tutorials were helpful in familiarizing me how to work with authenticated and authorized users, as well as how to write to my realtime database.

https://coderjourney.com/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-react-with-firebase/
https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/#react-firebase-protected-routes 
I used these tutorials to familiarize me with authentication and authorization with firebase + react, especially when it came to how I can set up protected routes.

Overall, I learned so much from this project and I'm so excited to continue working on the website and see it turned into a real venture through Campus Enterprises next semester! This application will be really useful in its practical purpose of matching students interested in projects to anyone looking to hire someone to do a project for them. 

User credentials for admin are vs111@duke.edu, password: valerie. The data I used came from the Duke Scholars API, and was used as dummy data since the real purpose of the website will entail user-generated data, which I have included for all of the users that have created accounts.

I initially chose to use React because of its currently high popularity. After doing the Explore project, I saw that the use of components was similar to Vue, so I thought it wouldn't be too hard to learn, and I liked the ease of not having to keep my html and javascript separate, and instead just having it all in the .jsx files. Through the Context API and higher order components, I was able to implement user authorization seamlessly, and keep my data shared and easily accessible across components. The React-Router also made navigation easy (but deployment really hard!!!).

Some things that I would have (and later will) implement given more time will be allowing students or researchers to filter the projects/profiles page by the different specifications that are part of each entry. In practice, the website will have a lot less entries, since the dummy data loaded from the API won't be included, so it wouldn't be as much of a problem. I would also link the email addresses listed in projects and profiles to allow users to directly reach out to someone they are interested in connecting with.
