Christian Leonard:
Make clear that it’s coding languages
Highlight active link
Fix input fields
Notification that project has been posted, return to my account
Add back to top link in projects page
Search bar to search for specific words in projects/profiles?

Rachel Settle:
Home redirects to sign up if no user is logged in
Sign up page:
-          When creating an account separate it into different lines
-          Display text above instead of as placeholder
-          Dropdown menu for languages
Home page:
-          If I’m a researcher, where would I go next?
-          If I’m a student, where would I go next?
-          Dead end page – add links to where you should go based on what kind of user you are
Projects/Profiles Page:
-          Can you click on email when you go through the project or profiles page?
-          Would be helpful to sort by language 
Since users fall into two categories (student or professor), the website could be more focused on this division. As a professor, the focus should be on the available students and their abilities (perhaps sort by language, or keyword in interests). As a student looking for a professor, the focus should be on current projects by professors, and what those professors are looking for in a student.

Riley Hockett:
Here are  some notes from your website demo:
make the boxes for languages dropdowns
put user name in the navbar
should be able to click on project in order to see more detailed view
Maybe don't load alll users on one page (batch load)
